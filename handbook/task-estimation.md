# Task estimation in Scrum

Task estimation is a vital part of scrum, helping teams plan sprints, forecast delivery, and manage stakeholders expectations.
In this section we will dive into the common guidelines of task esimation in scrum highlighting common challenges with estimation and strategies to midigate these while also laying out good and bad practices, using real- world experiences of developers and scrum team members. The aim is to give your team a better understanding of the right practices at the company in a simple practical guideline without overcomplicating the process or falling into bad habits.

## Good Practices
### Break down large tasks

Large or vague tasks can be difficult to estimate accurately.  
To improve clarity and estimation:

- Break down large tasks into **smaller, more manageable subtasks**.
- Ensure each subtask has a clear goal and can be estimated individually.

### Relative sizing

It can be difficut to estimate tasks precisely.  
To improve clarity and estimation:

- Use relative sizing estimate task compared to **baseline or refernece task**.
- Fibonacci sequence is good reference.

### Involve the whole team

Task estimation is a collaborative effort.
When the entire team is involved in the estimation process:
- Foster collaboration, commitment, and accountability.
- Leverage team members experitse and insights for more accurate task estimation.

### Resetimate when needed
- It's okay to resestimate if scope or requirements change mid sprint.
- Estimation is not a contract, keep it flexible.

  
## Bad Practices

### Time as an Estimation
Using time solely as an estimation.
Leading to:

- Someone may misunderstand time estimates as commitments rather than approximations.
- Focusing  on time can lead to underestimating the complexity or risks involved in a task.
- Time-based estimates often fail to reflect real progress.

### Tyring to be to precise
- The purpose of estimation isn't precision. You'll go too big sometimes and too small on other occasions, it all evens out over time.

### Insufficient acceptance criteria
If the acceptance criteria don't contain vital information, estimation is tough.
- If you don't know what the current behaviour is, it's going to be tricky to estimate the story size.
- Get your scrum master/analysts to clarify before you accept the story.


## Common Themes
From our research of developers experiences with time estimations in scrum here are some common themes and insights we found.
- **Time does not equal effort!** Time-based estimates often backfire, story points are much more reliable when it comes to estimation and help keeps things realistic.
- **Accurate estiamtion comes from discussion** The team conversations during estiamtion uncovers risks and insghts, which is more valuable then numbers.
- **Anchoring Bias or Group-Think** When a senior dev or individual gives a estimate first others tend to follow without challenge.
