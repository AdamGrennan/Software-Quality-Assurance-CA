# Project Plan: Software Quality Handbook

## Purpose
This project aims to create a practical and easy-to-use Software Quality Handbook for a small startup of 20 engineers. It will address best practices for improving consistency, reducing defects, and delivering high-quality software.

The handbook will include the following key topics:
- **Task Estimation in Scrum**
- **Code Reviews**
- **Continuous Deployment** 

## Workflow
We will follow a **Trunk-Based Development** process:
- Work will be done in feature branches.
- Pull Requests will be reviewed by both team members.
- Code will be merged into the `main` branch after teamates approval.

## Tasks & Responsibilities

## Summary

Given the tight deadline , we have decided to divide tasks based on clear individual ownership. Adam will focus on Task Estimation and contributions table, while Alvares will handle Code Reviews and the Handbook Introduction. We will both collaborate on Continuous Deployment, and peer reviews to ensure consistency and shared responsibility.

We chose Trunk-Based Development to encourage fast iterations and avoid bottlenecks in merging. Peer reviews are planned every second day to maintain alignment and quality.


## Notes
- Team call every second day
- Aim for 500 - 1000 words per topic
- Use bullet points & diagrams
- Use images 
- All sections must contain links to articles for further reading
- Highlight good and bad practices in sections
